DESIGN
We used the basic framework that was provided by the starter code to construct the program. Using the concept of Polymorphism, we wrote the code for the different pieces and used those functions in the make_move, in_check, in_checkmate, and stalemate functions. Finally, we created a destructor in Board to prevent any memory leaks from occurring. 

COMPLETENESS
The project is complete and has all required functionality.
